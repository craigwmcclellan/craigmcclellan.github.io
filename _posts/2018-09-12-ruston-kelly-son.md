ðŸŽµ [Ruston Kelly - Son of a Highway Daughter](https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/son-of-a-highway-daughter/1399137312?i=1399137507&uo=4at=1l3vwJx&ct=microblog&app=music)

A songwriter/producer here in Nashville once told me a song is just lyrics and melody. Everything else is production. This track proves that true.

I can't stop listening to this record. I'm officially obsessed.
