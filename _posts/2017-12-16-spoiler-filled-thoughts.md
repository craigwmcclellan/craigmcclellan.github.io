This post **contains spoilers** for The Last Jedi. 

Jacob Hall, [writing for SlashFilm](http://www.slashfilm.com/the-last-jedi-defense/2/):

> It’s telling that _The Force Awakens_ feels like a cinematic adaptation of our nostalgic *feelings about  Star Wars* instead of a *Star Wars* movie as conceived by George Lucas.
> 
> Perhaps that’s why *The Last Jedi* is such a jarring experience, one that feels specifically built to make audiences work through their feelings about this universe. Rian Johnson is unabashedly political and unafraid to slaughter the sacred cows.

For the first hour or so of the movie last night, I kept thinking *The Last Jedi * didn’t feel like a Star Wars movie the way *The Force Awakens* did, but I couldn’t put my finger on why. But slowly, as the movie went on, I got more and more excited about what I was seeing. 

I think this quote (and really the whole article) from Jacob Hall does a great job of summarizing how I felt. I went in expecting the second part of The Force Awakens and getting something entirely different...and that’s actually great. 

A few other quick thoughts:

- All along I wanted Rey’s parents to be nobody. I didn’t get many of my hopes or predictions, but this was one I was really pleased with.
- I’m also glad I didn’t go with huge theories as to who Snoke was. I wanted to know more about him, but I wasn’t obsessed. That turned out to be for the best. That whole scene and the lightsaber fight after were incredible.
- I’m still not sure how I feel about Luke trying to kill Ben. I think it served the story discussing the Jedi hubris well though.
- The main thing I didn’t really care about was Canto Bight. I could have done without that whole sequence. I liked Rose, and I liked her having a side adventure with Finn, but what they did didn’t do it for me. 
- On first watch, the premise with the Resistance fleet flying just out of range of the First Order felt like a Doctor Who plot line that you shouldn’t think about too hard. Not that that‘s terrible. I love Doctor Who. It just seemed like a thread you probably shouldn’t pull at.
- I loved the interactions with Luke and Rey as well as Rey and Kylo Ren. I thought Luke having a crazy old man vibe was fun.
- It’s strange that all 3 principal characters from the original trilogy are gone. With Carrie Fisher’s tragic death, I hope we get force ghost Luke in Episode IX. Not having any of them would be sad. 
- I can’t wait to see this movie again. I loved it.
