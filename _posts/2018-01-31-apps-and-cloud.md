[Apps and Cloud are redefining Computing â€“ Tech.pinions](https://techpinions.com/apps-and-cloud-are-redefining-computing/52131)

Carolina Milanesi:

> Our studies have shown that Millennials are all about being able to get to the applications they use every day. So do more engaged, experienced users. Both groups also embrace cloud services more eagerly. The combination of these two factors, apps and cloud, allows them to focus on the computing experience they want to have rather than focusing on the hardware they are using.

This doesn't allow me to be hardware indifferent though. It allows me to use the hardware I enjoy using the most (iOS devices), and still get work done in a school district that exclusively uses Office365.
