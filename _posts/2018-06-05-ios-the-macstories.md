[iOS 12: The MacStories Overview â€“ MacStories](https://www.macstories.net/news/ios-12-the-macstories-overview/)

> Finally, there's a new type of notification in iOS 12 designed for critical information. This opt-in alert will notify you even when Do Not Disturb is engaged. One use case Apple mentions for this feature is getting important reports from your healthcare provider, but it's unclear if these new 'critical alerts' will be limited to certain app types, or if any app will be able to take advantage of them.

I didn't catch this in other coverage today. I'm excited about the possibilities of this feature.
