While Matt Smith's 11th Doctor will always be my favorite, I think Peter Capaldi's 12th may have been the best Doctor. Since his final episode will be this year's Christmas Special, I thought I would share some of my favorite Capaldi episodes that I'll be watching before he goes:

- S8E1 - Deep Breath
- S8E4 - Listen
- S8E9 - Flatline
- S9E11 - Heaven Sent
- S9E10 - Hell Bent
- 2016 Christmas Special - The Return of Doctor Mysterio
- S10E12 - The Doctor Falls

All the seasons are available on Prime Video, which handily enough is now on Apple TV.
