Well, [@robbyburns](https://micro.blog/robbyburns) did it. He officially convinced me to move my task management to OmniFocus 3 from Things 3.

And if Castro comes out with Siri Shortcuts to play my Queue and a good watchOS 5 app, I'm fully switching my podcast client too. 

I don't even know who I am anymore!
