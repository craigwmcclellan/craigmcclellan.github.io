Thankful that counter protesters at the 2 [Middle Tennessee White Lives Matter Protests](http://www.tennessean.com/story/news/2017/10/28/white-lives-matter-rally-murfreesboro-tn-live-updates-shelbyville-tn-stream-video/) outnumbered the actual protesters, have stayed safe, and one protest was cancelled. Iâ€™m proud to be a Nashvillian today.
