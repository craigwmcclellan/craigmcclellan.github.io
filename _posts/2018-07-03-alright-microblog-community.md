Alright Micro.blog community, I’m wanting to write a workflow (or probably a Shortcut by the time I’m finished with it) to be able to post podcast episodes and images to micro.blog using the micropub API. I’m no programmer, but I can write a Drafts script and understand REST APIs. When I look at the micropub documentation on how to structure a multi-part/form request to the media endpoint, I may as well be reading another language. Has anyone successfully uploaded files to micro.blog using Workflow? Or is there a more user-friendly place to start with multi-part/form requests?
