I remember when the iPad Air 2 came out, people were astounded and confused by the amount of power (especially RAM) packed into it vs what iOS could do. The next summer, Apple announced iOS 9 with multitasking, and it all made sense. The hardware was prepared to take on the next big software evolution.

As someone who does his job from an iPad Pro now (and has a new one on the way), I do want more out of iOS. However, I am not going to be up in arms about it because I expect we'll see some game changing at WWDC.

I'm not excusing Apple for some missteps with iOS on iPad. It should be more capable in a lot of ways by now. But I'm also choosing to be optimistic this can and will change. Probably next year.
