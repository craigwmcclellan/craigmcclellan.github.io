I very rarely buy music anymore. When I do, it's usually from a local artist I want to support with more than my Apple Music subscription.

Recently, I was given a few physical CDs as a gift. While I don’t like to keep physical discs, if I actually own an album, I don’t want to just add it in Apple Music in case I ever cancel my subscription. Obviously I would be fine with music I receive through a subscription service going away if I cancel that subscription. However, I’m not ok with having to repurchase music I actually own.

So tonight I dug out a USB CD drive, connected it to my wife’s MacBook Pro, and ripped CDs into iTunes for the first time in years…

It might be easier to just buy those albums on iTunes if I cancel Apple Music than ever repeating this process again.
