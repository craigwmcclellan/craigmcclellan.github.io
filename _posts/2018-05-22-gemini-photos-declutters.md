[Gemini Photos Declutters Your Photo Library â€“ MacStories](https://www.macstories.net/reviews/gemini-photos-declutters-your-photo-library/)

I'm all for productivity apps or apps with server components having a subscription. A utility I would use every 6 months or so for 10 minutes doesn't warrant $12 a year though. If Gemini was a five dollar single purchase (even potentially 10 because the design is so nice), I would pick it up immediately.

I'm not a developer, nor do I want to be. I appreciate the difficulties they face though and hope they can find the right balance of pricing and value to be successful. I also hope Gemini is valuable enough to others for it to be a worthwhile endeavor for Mac Paw. When great apps succeed, it's better for everyone. It's just not going to be the tool for me.
