2 years ago today, the world lost the incredible Dr. Karyn Purvis. The [Karyn Purvis Institute of Child Development](https://child.tcu.edu/remembering-dr-purvis/) has a great tribute to her on their website today.

> While she is no longer here physically, her spirit is very much present in our work here at the Institute and in the work of like-minded individuals who are using TBRI® around the world.

We pray we are channeling her in our house for our girls on a daily basis. Though we never met her, Dr. Purvis has changed our lives as foster parents. We wouldn't survive doing this without TBRI and her work. We can never thank her enough for what she did for the foster care and adoptive communities.
