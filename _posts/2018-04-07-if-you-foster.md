If you foster, have adopted, or are interested in either, you need to attend the [Empowered to Connect Conference](https://showhope.org/our-work/pre-post-adoption-support/empowered-to-connect/) next weekend. It’s in Chicago, but is simulcast all over the world. We’ll be attending for our 4th year here in Nashville. It has changed our family in so many ways.
