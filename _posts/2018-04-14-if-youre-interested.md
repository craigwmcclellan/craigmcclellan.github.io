If you're interested in edtech and you aren't reading Bradley Chambers's weekly column in 9to5Mac, you're missing out. [Today's post](https://9to5mac.com/2018/04/14/making-the-grade-mac-repairability/) was a great one.

A little tip if you want to subscribe but don't want the fire hose that is 9to5Mac in your RSS reader: subscribe to [Bradley's website](http://chambersdaily.com), and he will link to his articles every week.
