I have the basic structure of my [ultimate JavaScript script for Drafts 5](https://github.com/craigwmcclellan/Public-Drafts-Scripts/tree/master/Airtable%20Notes) finished. There is a bug, likely a misplaced bracket, somewhere in the code, and I cannot find it for the life of me. If anyone wants to have mercy on my tired soul and look at it, I would greatly appreciate it.
