[Fighting the opioid and foster crisis by supporting families - The Hill](http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/politics/390026-fighting-the-opioid-and-foster-crisis-by-supporting-families)

> While it is wonderful that many Americans become foster parents to adopt or “save” children, we need wrap-around supports in local communities, and we need families now more than ever before who are willing to foster children for a period of time while parents overcome addiction. To stop negative societal trends that are ravaged by drug addiction, we need an “all hands on deck” approach to help vulnerable children in our own backyards.  

I agree with Senator Lankford that **all** families impacted by foster care need support and I believe reunification is important. We have fostered multiple children who were reunified, and it was a beautiful thing.

I also think foster children should have a right to permanency. At what point does sticking with a goal of reunification begin to hurt a child's wellbeing? If a 2.5 year old has been with foster parents over 2 years, how much more harmful would reunification be to the child than staying with the only family they know?

The foster care system is broken in so many ways, and it's always the kids who are the victims.
