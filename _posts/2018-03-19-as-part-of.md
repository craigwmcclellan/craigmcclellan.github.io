As part of a 2nd grade economics unit, my students had to write an opinion piece on the quality of a [Black Panther toy commercial](https://youtu.be/93rpR7Xkx_8). One of my students said:

> I thought it was cool because it had a boy and a girl in it (I'm a girl so I'm happy that a girl is in the commercial) so I don't feel left out.

Representation matters to kids. I can always do a better job with selecting diverse stories to read in class, and this is a good reminder of why it's important to do that.
