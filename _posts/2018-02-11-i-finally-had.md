 I finally had a few minutes to try to write a [script for Drafts 5](https://github.com/craigwmcclellan/Public-Drafts-Scripts/tree/master/Add%20to%20Things) that adds items to Things 3 using their upcoming automation features (currently in beta). This is more proof of concept because I havenâ€™t decided what I need to automate yet, but I love the possibilities.
