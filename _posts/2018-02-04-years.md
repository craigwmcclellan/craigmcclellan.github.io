Today we celebrate what my wife is calling our 2nd annual “Family Day.” On this day, 2 years ago, these girls were brought to us to foster. As we did last year, we went and got donuts.

As seems to be the case with many big days, somehow they end up being harder. There’s been a lot of crying and arguments between the girls today, but we wouldn’t trade it.

Today isn’t even significant to them. They’re so young and have been with us so long they don’t know any different. It is to us though.

I’m praying that this is the last Family Day where we don’t know what the future will hold for our status as a family. The last one where I can’t share their beautiful faces with you. The last one where we don’t share a last name.

I’m thankful for 2 years being Daddy to these amazing girls. Here’s to many many more.
