At 2AM, I received the following from Apple. I reluctantly went to bed hoping for the best. When I woke up, I had an email saying they had gotten through to AT&T, and I could complete my order.

Unfortunately, now when I go to buy the phone, it initially remembers my exact order, but then makes me go through contacting AT&T again. Once it does that, it tries to force me into the AT&T next program. It will not let me buy the phone outright.

Apple customer support opens at 7 central. School starts at 7:45 central. Praying I can get it resolved in that time.
